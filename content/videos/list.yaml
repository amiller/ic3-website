- name: "Enter the Hydra â€“ An Experimental Approach to Smart Contract Security"
  description: "Philip Daian talks about the Hydra project. In this talk, we will demonstrate a new approach to secure smart contract development that we believe has the potential to remove a large class of implementation bugs that has plagued the ecosystem. We will discuss connections to other topics in secure smart contract development and announce an effort to build the most secure Ethereum contract ever launched on the mainnet!"

- name: "Enter the Hydra: Towards Principled Bug Bounties and Exploit-Resistant Smart Contracts"
  description: "Ari Juels talks about the Hydra project. Vulnerability reward programs, a.k.a. bug bounties, are a near-universal component of major software security programs. Today, though, such programs have three major deficiencies. They fail to provide strong technical (or other) assurances of fair payment for reported bugs, lack rigorous principles for setting bounty amounts, and can only effectively incentivize economically rational hackers to disclose bugs by offering rich bounties. As a result, rather than reporting bugs, hackers often choose to sell or weaponize them."
