add/edit press entries
======================

**Updated March 29, 2018**

1. add / update news in `pressroll.ods.`
2. commit `pressroll.ods` and push

Travis-CI will do the rest (compilation, deployment, etc.)

Each row of `pressroll.ods` is of the form 
    ```URL | Name of Source | Date of Publication | Title of Story | Who is Mentioned | Category | feature flag```.

See `pressroll.ods` for examples for the last three columns; `Who is Mentioned` can be set to `all`, for general IC3-related news.
