# IC3 Director of Community (DC)

IC3 seeks a Director of Community to foster cohesiveness and dynamic interactions among IC3 faculty, students, and industry partners, and to spread the IC3 word throughout the greater blockchain community. The IC3 DC will design and implement initiatives and programs to:

- Maintain and strengthen IC3's reputation for research leadership in the blockchain community;
- Help establish IC3 leadership in blockchain education and the larger blockchain community;
- Popularize IC3 research via newsletters, talks, forum posts, videos, and other media;
- Identify and cultivate potential consumers of IC3 technologies and research results;
- Create and organize IC3 events; 
- Attract women and underrepresented minorities to IC3 and the larger blockchain community. 

While blockchain-relevant technical experience is a plus, it's not required. Quick learning is essential, as are initiative and the ability to thrive in a position demanding autonomy.

The position would ideally be based at an IC3 campus, but may be remote. Salary is commensurate with experience.
