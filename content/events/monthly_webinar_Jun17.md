The requirements and guarantees of cryptocurrency blockchains do not match those of the FinTech world, from transaction throughput, through security primitives, to privacy. Ittay will discuss how blockchain research is closing these gaps and some of the challenges that remain open.

## ABSTRACT
Cryptocurrencies have been on the rise since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, initially pushed by libertarian groups as currencies without central control.  But in recent years, the financial technology (FinTech) industry has taken notice. What appeals to this industry is the underlying protocols, called blockchain in the context of cryptocurrencies and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in the FinTech world. The security guarantees of blockchains can allow bank-to-bank (b2b) transactions to be settled in minutes or less, rather than in days as it happens today. Moreover, banks, insurance firms, accounting firms, and others are exploring novel services that are not possible today, but can be implemented on top of a blockchain.

However, the requirements and guarantees of cryptocurrency blockchains do not match those of the FinTech world, from transaction throughput, through security primitives, to privacy. We'll discuss how blockchain research is closing these gaps and some of the challenges that remain open.
