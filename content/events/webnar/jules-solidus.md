Professor Ari Juels, IC3 co-Director will present "Solidus: Confidential Distributed Ledger Transactions via PVORM". Registration is open for IC3 members.

 
**Abstract**: IC3 recently released prototype code to its industry members for Solidus, a practical system that enables on-chain yet confidential trading and settlement. Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing. In this talk, I’ll discuss the innovations behind how Solidus works and the applications for which it is intended.

 
**Bio**: Ari Juels is a Professor at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu/) ([Jacobs Institute](http://tech.cornell.edu/experience/jacobs-institute/)) in New York City, as well as a Co-Director of IC3. He was previously the Chief Scientist of RSA (The Security Division of EMC).
