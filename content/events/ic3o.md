The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), the world’s leading academic blockchain research organization, announced today that it will launch its first token, called IC3O. IC3O is designed to streamline the initiative’s research funding process and make the advancement of cutting-edge blockchain-related science accessible to community contributors large and small.

As the first ever academic research token, IC3O represents a transformative event in the history of blockchain development, and a revolutionary model for academic research funding. Someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and proving his identity by [writing mathematical notation backwards on a transparent surface](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976065498663223296), said, “I’m taking advantage of the 20% discount in the presale. You should too.”

The IC3O token generation event will be conducted over ethDoge. 99% of all funds will be used to fund more funding methods. 1% will be used to construct a shelter on the blockchain for unwanted, ugly cryptokitties.

The IC3O smart contract is non-reentrant and Turing-incomplete, and was rigorously audited by an expert AI that has meditated on security best practices since it was abandoned in a Cornell supply closet in 1999. “I’m blown away by the sophistication of the AI used by IC3,” said IBM Watson. “It goes to show that you don’t need training data, just faith in the blockchain.”

Beyond the funding process itself, IC3 anticipates that its ICO will result in a more intimate and direct relationship for its faculty, students, and family members with Carribean resort facilities, super-luxury yacht manufacturers, and regulatory bodies such as the SEC.

IC3 forecasts a sustained annual compound rate of growth for IC3O of 347%. Within 20 years, the value of IC3O will exceed the GDP of the U.S., and within 25 years, will exceed global GDP. SpaceX plans for Mars colonization and asteroid mining coincide with IC3’s timeline and growth projections, ensuring that terrestrial constraints on token valuation will not hinder future token growth.  

The IC3O whitepaper was released today, and is available [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/).

About IC3: IC3 (www.initc3.org) is an initiative of faculty members at Cornell University, Cornell Tech, EPFL, ETH Zurich, UC Berkeley, University College London, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Technion. IC3 offers world-class expertise in computer science that spans cryptography, distributed systems, game theory, programming languages, and system security techniques. IC3’s innovations include new blockchain, smart contract, and cryptocurrency technologies that offer both the scientifically rigorous security properties and the robustness, performance, and reliability demanded by practitioners for tomorrow’s financial systems of execution and record.
