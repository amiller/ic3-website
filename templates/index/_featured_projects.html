    <p>
      Legal contracts are written in natural language, which can introduce ambiguity as to their meaning. Blockchain-based smart contracts are writen in programming languages, which seems to give precise, objective meanings. But because the semantics of a smart contract can change if participants fork the underlying blockchain or revise its protocol,
      <strong>the meaning of a smart contract is always subject to this latent ambiguity.</strong>
