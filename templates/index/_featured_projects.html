<h2 class="ui header">Town Crier: Authenticated Data Feeds for Smart Contracts</h2>
<div class="">
    <p>In order to reason about the real world, smart contracts in
      cryptocurrency systems will rely on informational input from what we call
      authenticated data feeds (ADFs); such information can include stock
      prices, meteorological reports, news, and other current events.
      It is therefore important that an ADF be trustworthy,
      in the sense of providing security against manipulation by an attacker
      attempting to influence the outcome of a contract. By utilizing trusted
      hardware to provide reliable, digitally signed attestations on data
      to client contracts, the Town Crier system can serve as a trustworthy
      ADF under minimal trust assumptions about its operator.
      <strong>Town Cirer will be online for public test soon</strong>.
